# IDK_HPRINT Cipheranalysis Tools

Comprehensive security analysis and attack demonstration tools for the IDK_HPRINT HMAC-per-character approach.

## Overview

This module provides specialized cipheranalysis tools adapted for the new HMAC-per-character algorithm where each character in the fingerprint comes from a separate HMAC-SHA3-512 operation, taking the last character from the base58 encoding.

## Key Changes from ColCa

- **HMAC-per-character**: Each character generated from separate HMAC operation
- **Last character selection**: Takes last character from base58 encoding instead of first N
- **Character independence**: Each character has independent cryptographic strength
- **HMAC chaining**: Provides strong dependencies between characters

## Security Analysis Features

### Pattern Vulnerability Analysis

- Identifies weak patterns with low security bits
- Shows HMAC operation count per pattern
- Provides security level classification

### HMAC Chain Security

- Analyzes cryptographic strength of HMAC chains
- Tests resistance to various attack vectors
- Validates character independence properties

### Performance Benchmarking

- Measures HMAC operation performance
- Calculates security-to-performance ratios
- Shows linear scaling with pattern complexity

### Entropy Analysis

- Analyzes entropy efficiency across patterns
- Tests base58 character distribution
- Validates uniformity of HMAC output

### Attack Surface Assessment

- Identifies potential attack vectors
- Provides risk assessment for each pattern
- Recommends security mitigations

## Key Findings

**HMAC-per-character provides excellent security guarantees**

- Each character has independent cryptographic strength
- SHA3-512 ensures strong collision resistance
- Base58 last-character selection maintains uniformity

**IDK patterns offer progressive security scaling**

- IDK-Small: 38.1 bits (testing only)
- IDK-Medium: 84.9 bits (acceptable)
- IDK-Large: 131.8 bits (production ready)

**Attack vectors are well-understood and mitigated**

- Brute force: Protected by key length
- Birthday attacks: Only affect first characters
- Preimage attacks: Protected by SHA3-512 strength

## Security Recommendations

1. **Use IDK-Medium ([3,5,8]) or stronger for production**
2. **Employ strong random keys (â‰¥256 bits)**
3. **Regular security audits recommended**
4. **Monitor cryptographic research for new attack techniques**
5. **Consider quantum-resistant alternatives for long-term security**

**Important**: All attack demonstrations are for educational and security analysis purposes only. Use responsibly and only on systems you own or have permission to test.
