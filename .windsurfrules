# dCypher Project Description

# Python vs. Zig

- The python version is the original / proof of concept code
- We are currently writing the zig proxy code, which is a re-encryption proxy service implemented in Zig, providing both CLI tools and HTTP API for proxy re-encryption operations.

# Documentation

Whenever something in zig isn't working or is unclear, refer to the documentation: https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.14.1/
