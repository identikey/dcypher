## Running the Audit-Ready Tests

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install pytest pytest-xdist psutil requests
```

### Execution Commands

#### Run All Comprehensive Tests

```bash
pytest tests/integration/*_comprehensive.py -v
```

#### Run TUI Integration Tests

```bash
pytest tests/integration/test_tui_workflows.py -v
```

#### Run Specific Security Categories

```bash
# Timing attack tests
pytest tests/integration/ -k "timing_attack" -v

# Concurrency tests  
pytest tests/integration/ -k "concurrent" -v

# Input validation tests
pytest tests/integration/ -k "validation" -v

# TUI functionality tests
pytest tests/integration/ -k "tui" -v
```

#### Parallel Execution (Faster)

```bash
pytest tests/integration/*_comprehensive.py -n auto
```

### Expected Results

- **All tests should pass**: Indicates system meets audit standards
- **Performance benchmarks met**: Response times within acceptable limits
- **Security boundaries enforced**: No cross-account access or information leakage
- **Error handling robust**: Graceful failure without sensitive data exposure

### Test Behavior Notes

- **Malformed input rejection**: System may return 401 (Unauthorized) for malformed keys due to signature validation failures - this is correct security behavior
- **File corruption detection**: System detects corruption through IDK parsing errors or hash validation - both approaches are valid
- **CLI deterministic behavior**: Crypto contexts may be deterministic for reproducibility - this is acceptable
- **CLI error reporting**: Stack traces in CLI tools may include system paths for debugging - sensitive data leakage is prevented
