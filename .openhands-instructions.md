# DCypher Project Instructions for OpenHands

This document provides additional context and guidance for OpenHands when working with the DCypher project.

## Project Overview

DCypher is a quantum-resistant recryption proxy that enables private, shareable, and revocable cloud storage using proxy re-encryption (PRE) techniques. The project uses post-quantum cryptography to ensure long-term security.

## Key Guidelines

### 🚫 DO NOT Modify These Directories

- `vendor/` - Contains git submodules for external cryptography libraries (OpenFHE, liboqs, etc.)
- `build/` - Local build artifacts
- Build cache directories (`.pytest_cache/`, `__pycache__/`, etc.)

### ✅ Focus Areas

- `src/` - Main Python source code
- `tests/` - Unit and integration tests
- Configuration files (`pyproject.toml`, `Justfile`, etc.)

### 🔧 Development Workflow

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Parallel test execution (preferred)
just test
# or
uv run pytest -n auto --dist worksteal tests/

# Regular test execution
uv run pytest tests/
```

#### Development Environment

```bash
# Start Docker development environment
just dev-up

# Access development shell
just dev-shell

# Run CLI locally
just cli --help

# Build all dependencies
just build-all
```

#### Code Quality

```bash
# Lint code
uv run ruff check src/ tests/

# Format code
uv run ruff format src/ tests/
```

### 🏗️ Architecture Notes

1. **Cryptography**: Uses OpenFHE for fully homomorphic encryption and liboqs for post-quantum algorithms
2. **Package Management**: Uses `uv` for fast, reliable Python environment management
3. **Task Automation**: Uses `just` (modern Make alternative) for task automation
4. **API Framework**: Built with FastAPI for modern async Python web development

### 🔐 Security Considerations

This project handles cryptographic operations, so please:

- Be careful with key generation and random number usage
- Consider timing attacks and side-channels
- Test cryptographic changes thoroughly
- Understand that OpenFHE operations can be computationally intensive

### 🚀 Quick Start

For new contributors or when making changes:

1. **Setup**: `just build-all` (builds OpenFHE and liboqs)
2. **Test**: `just test` (runs full test suite)
3. **Develop**: `just dev-up` (starts Docker environment)
4. **CLI**: `just cli --help` (see available commands)

### 📚 Important Concepts

- **Proxy Re-Encryption (PRE)**: Core cryptographic technique that allows re-encrypting data for different keys without decryption
- **Quantum Resistance**: Uses lattice-based cryptography that's believed to be secure against quantum computers
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Allows computation on encrypted data using OpenFHE

### 🔍 Debugging Tips

- Use `just dev-shell` to access the development container
- Check logs in Docker containers for runtime issues
- OpenFHE compilation can take significant time and memory
- Test changes with small datasets first due to crypto overhead

### 🎯 Testing Strategy

- Unit tests focus on individual components
- Integration tests verify end-to-end workflows
- Cryptographic operations are tested for correctness
- Performance tests ensure reasonable execution times

Remember: This is a security-critical cryptographic system. Always test thoroughly and consider the security implications of any changes.
