# Python to Zig Migration Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level strategy for migrating functionality from the current Python implementation to Zig, with a focus on leveraging Zig's excellent C interoperability to handle the complex interfacing with OpenFHE and liboqs libraries while maintaining Python compatibility during the transition.

## Current State Analysis

### Python Implementation

  - `/crypto` - Crypto context management
  - `/accounts` - User account operations  
  - `/storage` - File storage and management
  - `/reencryption` - Proxy re-encryption operations
  - `/system` - System status and health checks
- **OpenFHE Integration**: Python bindings for homomorphic encryption
- **Thread-Safe Context Management**: Singleton pattern for crypto context sharing
- **User Interfaces**: Both TUI and CLI interfaces
- **Post-Quantum Crypto**: liboqs integration for quantum-resistant algorithms

## Conclusion

This migration strategy provides a low-risk, high-reward path to leverage Zig's performance and C interoperability advantages while maintaining the flexibility and ecosystem benefits of Python where appropriate. The phased approach ensures continuous functionality and allows for course correction based on real-world performance and complexity discoveries.

The key insight is using Zig as a high-performance backend library that Python can call, rather than an all-or-nothing replacement, allowing for the best of both worlds during the transition and beyond.
